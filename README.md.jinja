{{algorithm_description}}

This algorithm is designed to be run with the [vantage6](https://vantage6.ai)
infrastructure for distributed analysis and learning.

The base code for this algorithm has been created via the
[v6-algorithm-template](https://github.com/vantage6/v6-algorithm-template)
template generator.

### Checklist

Note that the template generator does not create a completely ready-to-use
algorithm yet. There are still a number of things you have to to yourself.
Please ensure to execute the following steps. The steps are also indicated with
TODO statements in the generated code - so you can also simply search the
code for TODO instead of following the checklist below.

{%- if use_vpn %}
- Review the EXPOSE and LABEL commands in the Dockerfile for VPN
{%- endif %}
- Include a URL to your code repository in setup.py.
- Implement your algorithm functions.
  - You are free to add more arguments to the functions. Be sure to add them
    *after* the `client` and dataframe arguments.
  - When adding new arguments, if you run the `test/test.py` script, be sure
    to include values for these arguments in the `client.task.create()` calls
    that are available there.
- We strongly recommend adding documentation to your code. This will help
  others to understand your code and will help you to understand your own code
  in the future.
- Finally, remove this checklist section.
